# Notes

There is a separate `$profile` for vscode powershell, you can see it by printing `$profile` inside a vscode terminal.

On the new work laptop it is at: `C:\Users\T884492\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`

This is a different location from `$profile` in a powershell session on windows terminal

On the new work laptop it is at: `C:\Users\T884492\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
